## Education
### Yonsei University - *B.S in Computer Science*
*March 2018 - Feb 2021 (Expected)*  
GPA 3.88/4.3 - Top 9% (13/143) of the class


## Research Experience
### NPUSim - *Intelligent Computer Systems Lab*
*June 2018 - Feb 2020  
Platforms/Languages: Linux, C++*   

NPUSim aims to simulate neural network accelerator, a.k.a. NPU, architectures 
as GPGPU-Sim simulates GPUs. The project puts emphasis on analyzing on-chip memory
 transaction between PUs and DRAMs using  Ramulator, DRAM simulator developed by Safari
 group at Carnegie Mellon University, as DRAM module to assess NPU performance in line 
 with that of DRAMs. - Project Lead from Feb. 2019 to Feb. 2020.  


## Projects
### RDBMS Emulation with Redis - *Team Project*
*Sep 2018 - Dec 2018  
Platforms/Languages: Linux, C, Python*  

Modified Redis source code to support SQL queries on Redis cluster with each Redis
 object being a table. Simulator has Python User Interface, and supports create, 
 insert, select, delete and update commands on single tables. Select command with
 where, group by and having clauses is supported as well. Source code is available
 [here](https://github.com/wjsgus95/RDBMS-with-Redis),
 scored 98/100 where the class average was 41/100.

### MiniC Compiler - *Individual Project*
*Sep 2018 - Dec 2018  
Platforms/Languages: Linux, Gradle, Java*

Developed compiler for MiniC which is a simpler version of C. Implemented recursive
 descent parser with visitor design pattern. Compiler takes MiniC code as input,
  and outputs Jasmine assembly code that runs on JVM.


### Proxy Server - *Individual Project*
*Oct 2018  
Platforms/Languages: Linux, Python*  

Developed HTTP proxy server in Python. The server removes header fields relevant
 to proxy connection to ensure transparent proxy. Multi-threaded and supports
 persistent connection. Source code is available 
 [here](https://github.com/wjsgus95/Python-Proxy-Server)
